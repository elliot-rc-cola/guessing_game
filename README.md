# Python Number Guessing Game

The game gives the user five attempts to guess the correct number.

After each guess, the game gives you a hint to say 'too high', 'too low', or 'getting close'.

The prompt before each guess is randomised sans the first and last which both say 'Give me your best guess'.

At the end of the game, the user will be asked if they want to play again. The game will either restart or say goodbye and end. 

There's error handling to ensure the user only inputs numbers between 1 and 100. There's also handling for the end of game sequence. You can only say 'y' or 'n', everything else will bounce back. 

Thoroughly enjoyed building this program. Can't wait to build loads more :)
